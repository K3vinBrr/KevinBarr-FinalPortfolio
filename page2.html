                    So far, I have been coding for about 2 years, on and off, and only really putting in half the effort that I can. However, in the upcoming years, I plan to start giving it my all and strengthen my knowledge of HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I also aim to learn more languages such as Rust, Python, and Node. While this portfolio isn't top of the line, it's also not just a beginner's attempt. My hope is to start on some personal projects in the near future. Whether it's creating programs to automate specific tasks or building websites, I want to demonstrate my skills. Additionally, I have always been interested in game development and might even try it.
