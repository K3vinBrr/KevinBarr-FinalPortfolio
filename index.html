                    Hello! I'm Kevin Barr, a 16-year-old (as of 2023) with a passion for coding, video games, and photography. For the past three years, I've tried to put myself into coding and diving into the world of programming. Video games have been an big part of my life since childhood, and although I haven't played at a professional and only slightly at semi-professional level, I've constantly challenged myself by competing against top-ranked players. In Valorant, I am sitting at Ascendant 3 and generally play immortal lobbies, showcasing how far I have gotten over the years. Similarly, in CS:GO, I currently am sitting at LE, while its not the highest, its only after a few days of playing somewhat seriously.
