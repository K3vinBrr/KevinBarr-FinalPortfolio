                    I have been gaming pretty much my entire life, starting off with TF2 and Garry's Mod. Eventually, I ventured into competitive FPS games such as Escape From Tarkov, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Valorant, Rust, Titanfall, Insurgency, and DayZ. Additionally, I have also played competitive non-FPS games including Mordhau, Starcraft, Diablo, and Path of Exile. Overall, I've put an inconceivable amount of time into just the first four games on the list, but I never really spent enough time grinding them to see how high I could rank or how far I could progress. However, Tarkov holds a special place in my heart as one of my favorite FPS games. Despite its extreme challenge and punishing nature, it remains incredibly enjoyable, creating heart-pounding moments of tension.
