                    While I wouldn't necessarily consider photography as a full-time job for myself, I genuinely enjoyed it and am planning on doing it more in the future. Last year, I took a Photo 1 class, and it was an incredibly fun experience. Although it covered the basics and mostly involved capturing images of other people or ourselves, it provided valuable information in a quick and digestible manner. Additionally, it helped me develop a greater appreciation for my surroundings as I actively sought out beautiful scenery instead of disregarding it. The class also introduced me to numerous features and techniques in Photoshop, enriching my skills. Overall, it was an extremely positive experience. Furthermore, for the majority of my photos, my main subject was Peter someone who was usually willing to cooperate... well, most of the time. Also heres some of the skills I learned overtime in a little list.
